Note: press "P" to display the presenter's notes that include some comments and
additional references.

### Lab and Home Assignment Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
the [github repository](https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/):

    git clone https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs

These notebooks only work with `keras and tensorflow`
Please follow the [installation\_instructions.md](
https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/blob/master/installation_instructions.md)
to get started.

Direct links to the rendered notebooks including solutions (to be updated): 

#### Lab 1: Neural Networks and Backpropagation

#### Lab 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

#### Lab 3: Embedding and Recommender systems

#### Lab 4: Natual Language Processing
